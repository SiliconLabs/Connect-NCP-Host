 * ::emberFrequencyHoppingStartClientCompleteHandler() is invoked
 * asynchronously to inform the application whether the node successfully
 * synchronized with the specified server or to inform the application of the
 * reason of failure.
 * After the client is synced to a server, it may seamlessly perform the
 * resynchronization process if needed. Sleepy devices in particular
 * periodically perform the resynchronization process. If the client fails a
 * resynchronization process, it informs the application by invoking the
 * ::emberStackStatusHandler() handler with ::EMBER_MAC_SYNC_TIMEOUT status.
 * When this occurs, the client will no longer be synced to the server.
 * The application may elect to attempt a new synchronization process by
 * invoking this API again.
 *
 * @param[in] serverNodeId   An ::EmberNodeId value indicating the node ID of
 *   the server to synchronize with.
 *
 * @param[in] serverPanId    An ::EmberPanId value indicating the PAN ID of the
 *   server to synchronize with. Note that this parameter is meaningful only if
 *   the node is not currently joined to any network.
 *
 * @return An ::EmberStatus value of ::EMBER_SUCCESS indicating that the node
 *   successfully initiated the synchronization process with the server,
 *   otherwise an ::EmberStatus value indicating the reason of failure.
